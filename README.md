# Advent of Code 2022

This repo covers some Julia answers to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/) problems. A brief summary of each of the statements of each problem is shown below.

## Day 1: Calorie Counting

The input is a list of numbers (calories) separated by empty lines (that marks the separation between each elf). The goals of the problem are:
- Part 1: Calculate the maximum value of the sum of blocks in the file. 
- Part 2: Calculate the sum of the 3 largest sums of blocks in the file. 

## Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors

The input is a two column list of letters. The first column represent the opponent elf's choice for the game rock (A), paper (B) and scissors (C). The second column represents:
- Part 1: The player's choice for the game rock (X), paper (Y) and scissors (Z).

- Part 2: The result of the game, i.e. if it is a lose (X), tie (Y) or win (Z).

Thus, choosing rock, paper or scissors gives 1, 2 and 3 points, respectively, and loosing, drawing or winning gives 0, 3 and 6 points. The aim is to see what score would be obtained in each case.
